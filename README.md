# Tasks To Do:

# Task A: Convert all CSV File into SAS Dataset and then, XPT Files

Keep all variable in character except for Date/Date-Time variables.

Input: CSV file

Output: SAS Dataset

QA: Using Proc COMPARE of SAS Datasets

# Task B: Create Analysis Datasets (Cohort selection dataset and Other Analysis Variables)

Refer Specification Excel sheet for list of dataset and derivation rules to create.
