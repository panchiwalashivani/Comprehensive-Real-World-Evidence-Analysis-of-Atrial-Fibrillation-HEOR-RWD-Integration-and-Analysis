********************************************************;
Take Index Date as 1st Prescription Date i.e. Request Date from Medication dataset.
Study Pop: Atrial Fibrillation ICD10 Code initial 3 characters: "I48"
-          Patients who has Atrial Fibrillation (ICD10 Code initial 3 characters: "I48")
-          AF occurred between '1Jan2007' and '1Jan2019'
-          Keep patient who are treated with below drugs and create cohort variable based on below.
-          Treated with one of three treatment groups in medication datasets
o   Cohort="NOAC" (There are 3 drugs in this cohort)
§  APIXABAN: NDC Code in (3089421 636297747) OR medication_name contains "APIXABAN"
§  DABIGATRAN: NDC Code in (5970108) OR medication_name contains "DABIGATRAN"
§  RIVAROXABAN: NDC Code in (50458577) OR medication_name contains "RIVAROXABAN"
o   Cohort =”WARFARIN”
§  WARFARIN: NDC Code in (31722327) OR medication_name contains "WARFARIN”
o   Cohort =”ASPIRIN”
§  ASPIRIN: NDC Code in (31722327) OR medication_name contains "ASPIRIN”
-          Request_Date is prescription Date
-          Select only patient with selected drugs + Specific Timeframe Records as per SAP
-          To Check if any patient falls in two different cohort category or not;
-          Dont need dup records as deriving cohorts;
-          Dataset has Cohort variable on which we would perform all analysis.
-          Still Inclusion Criteria & Exclusion Criteria needs to be applied
o   Inclusion Criteria:
§  Inclusion Criteria 1: Age > 18
§  Inclusion Criteria 2: Condition of AF (ICD10 Code initial 3 characters: "I48")
§  Inclusion Criteria 3: Taken specific medications etc.
§  Exclusion Criteria 1: Fracture Exclusion (
M81 - Age-related osteoporosis without current pathological fracture &
